Detecting Depression from Social Media posts using Machine Learning Techniques

Abstract
The use of Social Network Sites (SNS), particularly by the younger generations, has seen rapid growth nowadays. Social media platforms like Twitter which is a microblogging tool enable its users to express their feelings, emotions, and opinions through short text messages. Detecting the emotions in a text can help one identify the anxiety and depression of an individual. Depression is a mental health problem that can happen to anyone, at any age. There is a lack of systematic and efficient methods to identify the psychological state of an individual. With more than 58 million tweets generated daily, Twitter can be used to detect the sign of depression in a faster way. Recent studies have demonstrated that Twitter can be used to prevent one from taking an extreme step. Our Proposed depression detection and prevention system can detect any depression-related words or phrases from Tweets and also classify the tweets into depressed or not. This system is proposed to diagnose depression and prevent it.
